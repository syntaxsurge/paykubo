pay with USDC through x402, and autonomous OpenAI agents buy those tools with
receipts and on chain proof.

     agent run" and the funded budget card shows 0.90 USDC.
- **Voiceover:**
  > "Now I show why this is more than a normal API marketplace. I create an
  > autonomous run, let OpenAI choose from the paid tool catalog, set a 0.90

  9. **Verify on-screen:** The proof page shows proof hash, receipts, vault
     funding metadata, spend, refund metadata, and Morph attestation transaction.
- **Voiceover:**
  > "The agent is the automation layer on top of the same marketplace. OpenAI
  > plans the work, Paykubo quotes each paid API, the funded agent pays through
  > x402, receipts are recorded, and the final run is attested on Morph. The
  > proof page lets anyone audit what happened without exposing private API
  > keys, private prompts, or provider secrets."

  > "Paykubo proves the full loop. API owners can monetize existing APIs or
  > subscriptions. Buyers and developers can pay per request and receive
  > results. Agents can autonomously buy tools from a funded budget. Every paid
  > action produces receipts, and Morph proof makes the workflow auditable. Try
  > it at [DEMO_URL]."
