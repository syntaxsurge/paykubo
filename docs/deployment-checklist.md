## Verification Commands

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build
```

## Runtime Checks

- `GET /api/health` returns readiness checks.
- `GET /api/openapi.json` returns the OpenAPI document.
- `GET /api/reference` renders the Scalar reference.
- `pnpm seed:database` upserts wallet-scoped users and their provider profiles.
- `pnpm seed:admin-tools` upserts public provider-owned marketplace tools.
- `POST /api/agents/runs` creates a Launch Pack Agent run.
- `POST /api/agents/runs/[runId]/execute` uses OpenAI planning and synthesis
  when `AGENT_LLM_API_KEY` is configured, clearly labels deterministic fallback
  when it is not, requires funded production runs before spending, and completes
  paid actions when the agent spender is configured.
- `POST /api/agents/runs/[runId]/funding/prepare` and
  `POST /api/agents/runs/[runId]/funding/confirm` prepare and record the USDC
  vault deposit for production agent runs.
- `GET /api/agents/runs/[runId]/ledger` shows funding, spend, and refund events
  for a run.
- `POST /api/agents/runs/[runId]/refund` records unused agent budget refunds
  after terminal states.
- `POST /api/agents/runs/[runId]/attest` returns a proof with an explorer link.
- `GET /api/proofs/[proofId]` returns the public proof package.
- `POST /api/x402/products/{published-product-slug}/call` without `X-PAYMENT`
  returns HTTP 402 and a `payment-required` header.
- Browser Run & Pay signs a marketplace request from a connected wallet and
  returns a receipt after settlement.
- Credit-metered async listings return an x402 quote before provider work, start
  provider work only after settlement, and expose
  `POST /api/x402/orders/{orderId}/claim` when final usage requires a delta.
- Async provider listings that return editable project or workflow handoffs
  expose a public result URL such as `result.publicProjectUrl` or
  `result.cloneUrl`; the gateway treats that handoff as the completed paid
  result.
- Retryable provider outages such as temporary 5xx, Cloudflare, timeout,
  rate-limit, or provider-marked `retryable: true` responses keep escrow
  reserved and retry for up to 24 hours before refunding.
- `POST /api/credits/accounts`, `POST /api/credits/top-ups`, and
  `POST /api/credits/products/{published-product-slug}/call` support managed
  API-key credits with pre-call reservation and failed-provider release.
- `POST /api/providers/openapi/preview` imports a hosted or uploaded OpenAPI
  document and returns paid-listing candidates.
- `/marketplace` shows published API products.
- `/agents` and `/agents/new` show the autonomous agent lifecycle.
- `/proofs/[proofId]` renders without wallet auth.
- `/provider` shows only the connected wallet's owned listings, USDC revenue,
  recent request activity, agent-created calls, and fee split.
- `/admin/products`, `/admin/orders`, `/admin/agents`, and `/admin/receipts`
  show global server-side tables for ownership, usage, autonomous runs, and
  settlement reconciliation.
- `/billing` shows USDC receipts, managed credit balance, API key creation, and
  top-up/debit history.
- `/admin/operations` shows payment, adapter, wallet, and receipt readiness.
